# discordBot
This is simple discord bot I made using discord.js which can be used for moderating among us games and basic echo commands.
This was the first time I worked with node.js and it was fairly easy to understand and implement.
If you want to make your own discord bot, you can take reference from the main.js file and set it up.
First you will need to go to the discord developer portal and create an application. 
Then you can get all the information about your bot and add it to your server.
It is pretty easy to setup. To get your bot online just type 'node .' in your terminal and to stop it just press 'ctrl + c'.
In some places you need to enter the IDs of voice channels, text channels and roles. I have mentioned in the code where that needs to be done. 
You can find the IDs after turning on developer mode from your discord settings under the advanced tab.
Some of the files in the commands folder have are just to test the bot. Some files are named after my friends because I just made them to have fun and they are just echo commands.
The main motive for this bot was to moderate among us games easily.
Using the muteall and unmuteall files you can mute or unmute everyone present in a particular voice channel which makes it easy and more fun to play among us.
I will be further developing this bot to play music directly from different streaming platforms.
Thank you!
